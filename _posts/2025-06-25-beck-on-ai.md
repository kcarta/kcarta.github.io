I've watched & re-watched this wonderful ['The Pragmatic Engineer' episode with Kent Beck](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aSXaxOdVtAQ), and warmly recommend it to anyone whose interests cross over agile and programming and AI, as mine do.

The two industry newsletters I read faithfully are [Orosz's](https://newsletter.pragmaticengineer.com) and [Beck's](https://tidyfirst.substack.com), so it felt truly serendipitous when this episode landed!

# Highlights (for me!)

*Kent Beck is a Spurs fan! ⚽️ 🐓*

## The 'Coding Genie' analogy for Agentic AI  ([6:15](https://youtu.be/aSXaxOdVtAQ?feature=shared&t=375))

> You wish for something and you get it, but it's not what you actually wanted, and sometimes it seems like the agent actually has it in for you.

## AI Agent dev is "literally an addictive loop" ([9:30](https://youtu.be/aSXaxOdVtAQ?feature=shared&t=558))

In that you "click the button" and it works *magically*, with "intermittent reinforcement, negative outcomes & positive outcomes where the distribution is fairly random, seemingly."

## AI dev leverages great product management! ([12:30](https://youtu.be/aSXaxOdVtAQ?feature=shared&t=750))

> You can think really big thoughts, and the leverage of having those big thoughts is just suddenly expanded enormously.

> [I had this tweet 2 years ago](https://tidyfirst.substack.com/p/90-of-my-skills-are-now-worth-0), where I said '90% of my skills just went to $0 and 10% of my skills just went up 1000x'. This is exactly what I'm talking about - having a vision, being able to set milestones towards that vision, keeping track of a design to control the levels of complexity as you go forward, those are hugely leveraged skills now... compared to "I know where to put the & and * and {} in Rust" 

##  TDD as *agile programming* (Start ~ [42:00](https://youtu.be/aSXaxOdVtAQ?feature=shared&t=2515),  meat at [47:00](https://youtu.be/aSXaxOdVtAQ?feature=shared&t=2818))

Kent Beck gives a masterful summary of why 'test first' fits his desire to defer commitment, based on the assumptions that he will learn, and thigns will change.
> I can understand why you would make that assumption, that you already know what the implementation is going to be.
>
> ...and the more correct you are in that assumption, the less value there is to have the test first.
>
> I'm always going to bet, this is the most ignorant I'm ever going to be - today - I'm going to be more experienced tomorrow.
>
> So I assume I'm going to learn, and I'm going to assume things are going to change.
>
> The more those assumptions hold true - the more I have to learn and the more things are going to change - the less commitment I want to make right now, and the more I want to defer commitments to the future.
>
> The more you can predict, the bigger the jumps you can make.

I love it!
