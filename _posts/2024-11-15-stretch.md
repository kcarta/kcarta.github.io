The Apple Watch feature that amuses me most is the reminder to stand up regularly. I spend the large majority of my days sitting or lying down, and so although the nudging is greatly appreciated, I can't help but feel embarrassed for myself when I take in my digital reward:

As someone who has oriented my life around staring into a computer monitor, I have a natural ceiling on my daily physical activity, which I'd put at 'light' or at best 'moderate'. My 'fitness' routine includes circa 1 hour of energetic walking a day and about 1 hour of indoor bouldering 2-3 times a week (at the time of writing I also spend many minutes a day lifting a 5kg baby up, down, and all around, which my watch considers 'workouts' - so I've got that going for me...).

Due to my sedentary choice of work + hobby, plus experiencing many car accidents and countless mosh pits in my young adulthood, I have light, but chronic, stiffness and soreness across my back, shoulders, and neck.

This is all to say, **stretching** is something I can always do more of.

Lately, I've been experimenting with how far I can take Apple Shortcuts, to help with things like this.

While at the climbing center today, I thought "if I could just remember to stretch the days I'm not climbing..." - whith this in mind, during a break, I took a swing at a Shortcut + Automation, and am pleased with the result:

The hardest part was the first, making a Shortcut that adds a new reminder for *tomorrow morning*. The solution feels kludgy, but it works well enough and fits on a single screen:

Next, I made an Automation that runs every time I leave the climbing center[^1]:

It works! Now, the hardest part, actually following through on the reminder üòá

[^1]: I've used location-based reminders before, for example to remind me to register parking when I visit a customer's office where this is both necessary and easily forgotten. This has an unfortunate consequence of firing when I'm just passing by - but I can always stand to stretch more, so in this case I can live with this being run when I'm not visiting the gym üòù
