This week, I've been digging my new Apple Watch Series 10 (my first ever 'smart' watch!) while following too closely to [Apple's week of M4 product launches](https://www.macrumors.com/2024/11/02/top-stories-new-m4-macs/), banging my head on my keyboard trying to grok [video streaming](https://www.reddit.com/r/WebRTC/comments/vt8gw7/best_option_for_getting_rtsp_streams_into_webrtc/), binge-watching (again again) every [Miyazaki-directed film](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_works_by_Hayao_Miyazaki), deepening my respect for the living legend [Alan Cooper](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-wtGFgaKYI0&list=WL) (more on that soon!), and marveling at Boston Dynamics' [fully autonomous Atlas demo](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F_7IPm7f1vI).

Following on last week's playing around with [Claude Artifacts](https://www.anthropic.com/news/artifacts), I went on a tiny-app building spree, culminating with a mini-site I slapped together in under 1 hour - https://gizzdropwatch.com (Gizz a fan name for the prolific psych-rock band King Gizzard & the Lizard Wizard).

It was an exhilarating experience and a glimpse into what rapid application development could look like in the very near future. I'll have a full post on this, but the gist is, I used Claude to generate the layout & styling (which is where I'm usually very slow and uncreative), and I wired up the JS (replacing the junk Claude generated) with a back-end, all hosted on [Azure Static Web Apps](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/products/app-service/static). By the time the dust settled, I had a fully-working app hosted on a custom domain, all in under an hour!
