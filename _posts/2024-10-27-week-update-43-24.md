This week, I’ve been exploring [Claude Artifacts](https://www.anthropic.com/news/artifacts) and rediscovering the joy of [LLM-driven RAD](https://simonwillison.net/2024/Oct/21/claude-artifacts/) (*post to come*), deliberating between the 42mm (too small!) and 46mm (too large!) sizes on the new Apple Watch Series 10, learning [whatever happened to Google Books](https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2017/04/the-tragedy-of-google-books/523320/), hopping back onto Ruby on Rails in [great anticipation](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-cEn_83zRFw) of [the version 8 release](https://rubyonrails.org/2024/9/27/rails-8-beta1-no-paas-required), putting the [Twin Peaks soundtrack](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z30zg9a5M5k) on infinite repeat (fab for putting baby to sleep 👨🏻‍🍼), and marveling at [Ang Lee’s underrated 2003 Hulk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ErnLuJKQA4) and the hyper-stylized direction comic book movies could have taken.

Most importantly, I decided to start posting again! I have a backlog of posts, drafts, and ideas, and should be rolling them out regularly. 

I’ll also be posting weekly updates like this one, inspired by the [Installer newsletter](https://www.theverge.com/installer-newsletter). Again, this site is for my own use primarily, and I find it’s fun to dig back into past writing and remember what I was doing at different points in time.

That said, looking forward to engaging on some intriguing topics to come! The world has become nothing if not more…interesting…in the years since I stopped writing regularly 😮
