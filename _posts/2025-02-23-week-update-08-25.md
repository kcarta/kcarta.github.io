This week practically melted before me, one of those where I can read my calendar and go "sure, if that's what you say happened this week" ðŸ« 

Now a full 8 weeks through the year, I feel like I'm at a point where I can tell what I can and can't reasonably expect to accomplish - both at work and at home - unless or until something fundamentally changes.

I've also been tracking and tweaking my digital choices. I'm still consuming as much screen time as ever, but seem to be making better choices on the whole - vital these days not to be staring into the void too long, too often ðŸ™ˆ

A grab-bag of things have taken my attention this week, including:
- Getting my hands on the incredible [4k77, 4k80, and 4k83](https://www.thestarwarstrilogy.com/project-4k77/) fan remasters of the original Star Wars trilogy, after rewatching the Prequels to great dissatisfaction (which seems to increase with each rewatch),
- Nodding my head along to the [U.S. Digital Service's "Playbook"](https://playbook.usds.gov/), and pining for a time - or an alternate timeline, now - when the American government could do great and inspiring things, at least on occasion,
- Learning about [The Bazaar](https://playthebazaar.com/game) from a co-worker, but then ultimately deciding to get [Slay the Spire](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slay_the_Spire) on my phone as a way to play games again (first phone game in over 10 years!), without it taking over my life,
- Daydreaming about [opening up a local computer club in my city](https://startacomputer.club/), and what that would entail,
- Flipping through a vintage "[Getting Started with Your Macintosh](https://vintageapple.org/macmanuals/pdf/Getting_Started_With_Your_Macintosh_1990.pdf)" manual after seeing it on Jerry's desk on an early episode of Seinfeld (does it show how to use a computer mouse? You bet your sweet monochrome CRT it does!),
- Reading about how [my dear old love Vim has continued on](https://thenewstack.io/vim-after-bram-a-core-maintainer-on-how-theyve-kept-it-going/) in the year-and-a-half after the death of its author and maintainer of 3+ decades, Bram Moolenaar.
