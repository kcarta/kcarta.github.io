# Intro

If I had to reduce the work I do to just 10 words, it would be: *"figuring out what to do and why to do it."*[^6]

As I work with development teams as a project|product|delivery lead,[^3] I typically contribute in the form of "User Stories".

Taking stock of my past deliveries, I've written[^5] *at least* 500 User Stories a year,  consistently over each of the last ~5 years.[^1] I'm fortunate to have worked with stellar teams that have all (roughly) managed to keep pace while also keeping me on my toes and learning.[^2] 

I wrote my fair share of User Stories as a developer too, so combined with all the practical learning & theory I've picked up over the years, I feel it's fair to say I know a thing or two about these.

So why is it that whenever I'm asked to "give an example of a good User Story", I freeze up? 
Why does coming up with "good" examples feel like pulling teeth? 

> *Why is it so hard to answer this question, and seemingly getting harder the more experience & knowledge I gain?

> Main point: It's really hard to come up with an example for a great user story in a vacuum, because user stories are best when they make use of a rich shared context, and don't have to come pre-packaged with all the necessary information to understand them.

## What's in a story?

Let's lay some groundwork.

In short, a User Story 
- A ticket to track through a delivery system
- A request for a conversation between the developer and the user (or user representative)

## Context

The easiest reason I can point to, without incriminating my own deficiencies, is that I lack a shared frame of reference to 

A User Story is an answer to the question "tell me one thing that would create some value if it were possible". 

If you're not thinking about value, but instead about specifications or effort or deadlines, then I cannot give you an example of a good User Story because *it will make no sense.*


I've worked with a lot of different organizations, in recent years in a coaching capacity to boot. I also have a wide professional network where I glean all sorts of juicy stories.

I'm confident in stating that *most* development teams:
- *Do not think about the work they do in terms of value to users.*
- *Do not communicate directly with users (or effective representatives).*
  - *And if they do, they do not have a shared language with users in which to discuss the domain*

If the "why" that a User Story answers is mostly about perspective and purpose, then a certain level of user & domain understanding is necessary to get to a "good" User Story.


The time always inevitably comes, where I introduce 

## Whose story is it anyway /value driven development

> How it's hard to focus on the value, who is the driver of the work - is it the user? The developer? All of this needs to be in our shared domain vocabulary, and if we don't have that, then we will struggle to talk

## A good story is hard to find

## So, can I get an example, or what?

[^6]: If I could add five short words more, I'd include "and how to do it", in process and/or implementation.

[^3]: Gosh these terms are getting painful to juggle, can't we all just swallow our pride and agree we're all just differently-flavored project managers at the end of the day?

[^5]: I don't usually do this work alone, to be sure - typically I'm in close collaboration with a BA, designer, architect, developer, superuser, etc., depending on what we're building. In all cases, it's me with the final responsibility for what gets written.

[^1]: In addition to a number of Bugs, a number I will keep to myself 😉

[^2]: Of course, a healthy number of Stories end up dying on the backlog for various reasons.
