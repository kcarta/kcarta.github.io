This week, I've been taking multiple trips down the winding road of hopes, dreams, fears, jealousies, and uncanny dream logic that is  [Mulholland Drive](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mulholland_Drive_(film)), grounding myself back in reality by endlessly tweaking [my Emacs config](https://github.com/kcarta/.emacs.d), reading about the fascinating series of events that lead to the development of [Visual Basic](https://retool.com/visual-basic)[^1] and musing again on the halcyon days of enterprise R.A.D., condensing my thoughts on ["what a manager does (and shouldn't do)"](http://rachelbythebay.com/w/2024/11/03/metrics/), digging into [advanced architectures in Flutter](https://hackernoon.com/flutter-state-management-with-rxdart-streams), and circling back as I often do to Willie Nelson's pivotal [1973 'Shotgun Willie'](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CHob34QxEXQ&list=OLAK5uy_lp-3dPRRdXwlLNYc2gPmgcfgJI3CKooLY).

This week, I've been struggling with some impostor syndrome, the obvious result of watching & reading too much [David Heinemeier Hansson](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X_Hw9P1iZfQ), and letting myself get triggered by a Willie Nelson line *"you can't make music if you ain't got nothing to play"*. For context, I'm approaching 6 years of working as a tech PM (i.e. not as a dev), as well as 2 years of leaning heavily on LLM's to write code for me, the result now being too many uncomfortable moments of "code block" where I stare into my monitor and try to remember how to do very simple coding tasks (like how to pass a block to a Ruby function or write a simple stateful widget in Flutter). It's a hard hole to dig myself out of, and past experience has taught me the only way through is a combination of perspective-taking and just moving forward - nothing beats the impostor blues like making working software...
