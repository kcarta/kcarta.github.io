This week *flew by* ðŸš€

I'm happy I keep these lists, because without a record of what I've been doing and thinking, this is definitely one of those weeks that would have been subsumed and forgotten in the ever-churning tides of time.

This week, I've been:
- Struck with delicious dread after seeing Robert Eggers' [Nosferatu](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nosferatu_(2024_film)) in the cinema,
- Re-visiting a dear old friend, QueensrÃ¿che's 1988 opus [Operation: Mindcrime](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ilNOTmGWqDs), steeped in 80s metal hoke, but delightfully listenable and, if you allow it to sink in, eerily relevant,
- Ruminating on the 4+ years of toxic media to come, and in looking for coping strategies,  finding:
  - [Ezra Klein's interview with Chris Hayes](https://podcasts.apple.com/dk/podcast/the-ezra-klein-show/id1548604447?i=1000684362481) to offer a useful framework for "attention as a commodity",
  - Joey Einerhand's [overview of RSS feeds](https://joeyehand.com/blog/2025/01/15/i-ditched-the-algorithm-for-rssand-you-should-too/) to be an inspiring nudge back into curated feed-based consumption and highly relevant to a post I've been mulling over for weeks,
- Investigating (without any intriguing results yet), OpenAI's new [scheduled tasks feature for ChatGPT](https://help.openai.com/en/articles/10291617-scheduled-tasks-in-chatgpt
),
- Bookmarking two helpful resources for:
  - Using `ffmpeg` for various tasks, something I've never done successfully without [copy-pasting from a reference](https://ffmpegbyexample.com
),
  - Improving how I [convert to/from Markdown and Org formats](http://yummymelon.com/devnull/converting-a-markdown-region-to-org-revisited.html) in Emacs, using my all-time favorite tool, `pandoc` ðŸ™Œ
