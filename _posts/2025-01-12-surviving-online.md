I struggle with 'discourse' in the form of online comments. Overwhelmingly I experience comment threads to be unhelpful at best and mentally & spiritually poisonous at worst. Yet I have a deeply-reinforced habit of seeking them when I'm consuming online articles and social media.

Online comments have an uncanny ability to trigger the deepest parts of our ape-brains, where survival itself hinges on social acuity. For me, comments are like some eldritch object; no matter how much I know they can consume my very mind and soul, I cannot resist reaching out for them. 

Sometimes, my rational mind will jump in and justify reading comments - "maybe I didn't understand the full point of the article/post, I bet there will be some insightful comment". Most often though, comment-seeking seems to spawn out of the deeper recesses of my subconscious, from some unfulfilled (unfulfillable?) need for social validation, drama, and commiserating over events good and bad (usually the latter).

Unfortunately I have no answers as yet for how I successfully **avoid** online comments & threads.[^1] Obviously this would be an ideal long-term solution.

As long as I subject myself to online 'discourse', I have developed a handful of questions I consider whenever I find myself consuming a comment thread. 

Take these as a sort of heuristic for answering *should I stay or should I go?*, and thereby surviving as a denizen of the increasingly toxic web:

- Why am I reading this thread? What do I stand to gain?
- Is the subject matter in this thread relevant for the site its on?
	- I.e let's not expose ourselves to a heated thread about public policy on a site full of tech bros.
- Given the site & subject matter, how **likely** is it that any given commenter will be...
  - a bot?
  - a troll?
  - a Russian troll?
  - a lunatic?
  - an actual person?
  - an expert?
  - confidently ignorant?
- *Would it matter if any given comment was actually written by one the above?*
- What incentives & disincentives does a commenter on this site have:
  - For being insightful?
  - For being funny?
  - For lying?
  - For bullshitting?
  - For trolling?
  - For rage-baiting?
  - For sympathy-baiting?
  - For dogpiling?
  - For extremism?

[^1]: A few years ago I managed to go some weeks without reading *any* comments, but relapsed hard afterwards. I've played around with plugins to remove comments in places like YouTube, but these only work in specific contexts and sites.
