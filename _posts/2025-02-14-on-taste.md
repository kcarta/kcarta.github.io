I came to a realization recently.

One key difference between people I admire and people I don't is whether they demonstrate *good taste*.

My big realization? This holds especially true *at work*:

> The people I enjoy working with the most typically demonstrate 'good taste' - and those I don't particularly like working with, typically don't.

This opens a can of worms! Isn't taste subjective? Wait - what even *is* taste?

I turn to Merriam-Webster:

<blockquote>
Taste | noun<br>
...<br>
5a: critical judgment, discernment, or appreciation<br>
b: manner or aesthetic quality indicative of such discernment or appreciation
</blockquote>

This definition resonates:
- To be **critical** of something requires a level of **care**.
- To be **discerning** of something requires a level of **attention**.
- To be **appreciative** of something requires a level of **openness**.

All three are strengthened by qualities like thoughtfulness, intelligence, experience, and emotional sensibility.

On a fundamental level, taste seems to interact highly with **intuition**, both in *having taste* and *judging taste.*

As a rough framework, I think this works - hopefully enough to gather some insights.

## My own taste

Before I go further, let me clarify: I'm not claiming to be an arbiter of taste, *generally speaking*. My recent music history includes '[lo-fi sonic the hedgehog remixes](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSOgJ0Vnn1Q&list=PLXRkwGvXTai4-TWd6zTFo-qZd6vppuLYx)', and I've watched all 750+ videos by a [man who makes sausages out of random things](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lClgYiYqnD8). I have enough self-awareness to acknowledge this.

But for my work, which is **delivering software**, I have enough accumulated knowledge & experience to feel justified claiming some authority in judging taste.

If I can assume the following statements are reasonable:
1. Taste is something that can be described and judged, *if not entirely objectively*
2. I can trust my own taste and judgment, *if only where software is concerned*

This leads me to ask: what is good taste at work, especially in software development?

What common characteristics do I see in myself and in those I work with that I tend to find *tasteful*?

## (Dis-)Tasteful workplace behavior

Here's an attempt to catalog behaviors and see if useful patterns arise.

### Some behaviors I find **tasteful** in a software development workplace:
- Knowing when to say 'no' and how to say 'yes'.[^1] 
- Selecting the appropriate communication method for the task or information at hand.[^2] 
- Relying on high-quality sources of information.
- Carving out time to be available.
  - Even better, without having to book a meeting.
- Taking extra effort to improve quality, even just a little bit ("leaving things better than you found them").
- Using the right tools for the job, and taking an effort to learn how to use those tools effectively.
- Knowing & respecting agreed ways-of-working.
  - Even better, knowing how to establish new ways-of-working respectfully.
- Making a [reasonable effort to resolve an issue](https://xkcd.com/627/) before asking for help.

### Some behaviors I find distasteful:
- Being chronically 'busy' and out of touch.[^3] 
- Know-it-all-ism.
- Sloppiness.
- Closed communication.[^4] 
- Taking unnecessary risks to get something 'done'.
  - Even worse, breaking agreed ways-of-working to do so.
- 'Going rogue' by breaking agreed ways-of-working and team/org norms just to get something 'done'.
- Responding before having fully listened.
- Not recognizing & accounting for one's own weak points.
- Repeating the same mistakes over and over again (see above).
- Concealing issues.

I'm sure there are many, many more examples - I know this in fact, because I've been asking people for their thoughts all week ðŸ˜„

## Concluding thoughts

So, what can I take away from this?

For one, this model offers a fun little way to get perspective.

One interesting pattern: few of these apply to *writing* software specifically. As a firm believer in [software being written by people, for people](https://www.pechakucha.com/presentations/the-human-side-of-software), I find it unsurprising that my choices are mostly about good collaboration - but still, perhaps my lists would differ if I'd drafted them back when I was a developer.

I know I can't change others' behavior, but I can model the behavior I want to see. Looking at my lists and self-reflecting seems a good start - I can already see some I'm falling short on.

I'd caution against applying this frame of thought too liberally. There is value to diversity, also in behavior - to an extent. The behaviors I listed were meant to be clearly desirable or undesirable and fit the specific types of software development environments that I've worked in. Change the context or the example behaviors, and the usefulness & appropriateness of this model will change too.

[^1]: I think this might be *the* key skill for any leader, and in particular what separates bad product owners/managers (the overwhelming majority) from the good.
[^2]: This goes for documentation too, not just meetings that could have been messages. And especially [don't just write 'hi'](https://nohello.net/en/)! In person, this could also mean giving colleagues space if they've clearly been distracted too much already.

[^3]: See 'when to say no' - the farther I get into my career, the less respect I have for colleagues who are terminally 'busy', in that their capacity never seems to meet their responsibilities. More often than not, these people either have a broken internal drive or (worse in my opinion) have let their leadership or organization fail them, creating a toxic situation for them and everyone around them.

[^4]: Wherein relevant information is purposely withheld and lines are one-way. Especially when used to avoid taking responsibility for controversial decisions.
