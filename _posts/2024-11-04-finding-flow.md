> Note: This post is the first in a series, and I consider it 'work in progress'. I will likely come back and rewrite this as I develop my thoughts on this topic.

When leading a development team, I have two overriding concerns:

- Maximizing the value produced by the team's effort
- Minimizing the team's effort that goes towards waste

Most of the time, I feel well-equipped to steer the first concern. There are a myriad of practices and frameworks I can apply, and I love collaborating with my team members, customers, users, and so forth to this end. 

Minimizing waste, however, is a challenging beast, especially with all the things that threaten a developer's ability to focus on the goal(s) at-hand.

Over the past years, much ink has been spilled on the topic of the ['developer flow state'](https://stackoverflow.blog/2018/09/10/developer-flow-state-and-its-impact-on-productivity/), and the damage distractions cause on a developer's ability to work effecively. As an engineering manager, it is hard not to be conscious of this; I spend much time and thought on ensuring my team members are able to find and stay in flow, and feel great shame when I find us falling short.

This led me to think: when am **I** *in flow*?
What does it mean for me, as a manager and leader, to be able to achieve a *flow state*, and what am I doing when I am in that state? Should I desire & fight for this for myself, the way I do for my team members?

It's easy to brainstorm the times I'm decidedly *not* in flow:
- Back-to-back-to-back meetings: here I often find myself in fight mode (as opposed to flight), which might feel like flow when I'm really rolling, but is likely something else...
- Open office distractions: I *like* to put myself in a place to be available, however this means when I am not in meetings, I am often distracted by random requests for help - I'll gleefully drop anything for an opportunity to discuss at a whiteboard! This can be a *good thing* when it can steer team effort back in the right place, but even in the best cases this comes at the cost of my time and opportunity to focus.
- Digital distractions: the constant flow of new emails, Teams / Slack pings, etc.
- ...

This year, I have curated new tools for handling the constant flow of digital distractions & keeping my task-pile ordered, even as I chain meetings and jump at requests for help. [Emacs & org-mode](https://orgmode.org) has been a godsend for ordering my chaotic work life and keeping me focused on my priorities, and has replaced Notion as my daily organizer at work.

I also have an internal toolkit I go to often to keep myself effective at work, and I've learned to detach and go on offline walks & coffee breaks when I do need to disappear for a while. 

However, going back to flow, I feel my tools & practices can at best be used to prioritise my efforts, but not to help me reach or maintain flow, or give me useful things to do in a flow state.

As a parting note for this post, and a teaser to my working ideas on this topic, I reckon flow state is most valuable for *creative activities* - e.g. developing software - which begs the question, when am I as a manager *creative*? Could the answer be as soul-crushing as "when I'm plugging away in Excel and writing contracts"? Or are there more valuable things I can achieve in a flow state?
