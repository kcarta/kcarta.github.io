I keep lots of lists, mostly due to my tendency to forget anything I haven't written down.

In my head, 2024 was a short year, in which little happened - other than me spending the first 9 months preparing for impending fatherhood, and then spending the final 3 months wholly consumed by it 👨🏻‍🍼

But when I gather my lists from the year, a different picture emerges, of a year packed with oodles of activities, side-projects & hobbies, and some very busy periods at work 👨🏻‍💼

For the record (i.e. my own faulty memory), what follows is my best effort at listing the notable events & activities from my 2024.

## Personal:

### Big stuff
- Became a father 👨🏻‍🍼
- Became a Danish citizen 🇩🇰♥️

### Little stuff
- Traveled ✈️: Andorra 🏔️, Moldova 🍷 (least ✈️ travel since COVID)
- Completed the NYT crossword, without hints, every day on the day for all of February: 
![My February record in the New York Times crossword](/static/img/posts/crossword.jpg)
- Went to [Copenhell](https://www.copenhell.dk) 🤘, wrecking myself in ~20 mosh pits over 4 days 😵
- Took lots of trips to CPH for work & concerts 🚊
- Sold our diesel car (VW Polo) and leased[^1] an electric car (VW ID.3)
- Regular DnD / RPG sessions with 2 long-running groups 🎲
- Summer "glamping" trip to the west coast of Denmark, where I learned that my preferred style of camping is *indoors in a posh, well-equipped cabin, watching the Wimbledon + Euro finals 🎾⚽️ and occasionally enduring a short walk over to the spa 🧖🏻‍♂️*

## Professional:

### Work/Projects

This year, as a tech PM / delivery lead, I delivered:
- A combined product & GenAI research pilot for a large Danish public infrastructure company.
- A Vision AI product for tracking plant biodiversity for another large Danish public infrastructure company.
- A mobile app with IoT tool integration to support safety-critical construction & service for a large Danish enterprise.
- New modules in a complex mission-critical data platform for a large Danish enterprise.

Additionally, I (re-)joined a startup product team to help out as a Scrum Master  (and got to code a bit!), and got my hands on the Apple Vision Pro and assisted in a few customer demos.

### Work/Leadership

Outside of my direct project work, I:
- Re-organized & ramped up our ~15-person 'delivery management' practice group.
- Acted as 'team lead' for 8 colleagues over the course of the year.
- Was active in my business unit leadership, running our weekly steering meetings & taking part in strategy discussions.
- Assisted in interviewing, hiring & (primarily) onboarding a slew of new colleagues, including 5 new Sr. PM's across our offices.
- Helped revamp our account management & strategy setup towards our largest customer. 
- Took part in a cross-office guild for 'Agile Coaching', hosting a session myself on my experiences & lessons learned as an Agile Coach.
- Took part in a weekly cross-office peer-coaching group.

### Workshops & Conferences Attended
- [GOTO Aarhus](https://gotoaarhus.com/2024) in person.
- [Emacs Conf 2024](https://emacsconf.org/2024/) online.
- Followed [WWDC 2024](https://developer.apple.com/wwdc24/) closely online.
- 1-day Masterclass on User Stories & Use Cases with [Alistair Cockburn](https://alistaircockburn.com).
- 2-day AI Hackathon - with a co-worker, made a [LLM-based tool to query a relational database in free/semantic text](https://github.com/kcarta/ai-hackathon-sql-gen) (i.e. "what customers should we increase our sales effort on next year?").

### User Groups
- Happily taking part in [Aarhus Ruby Group](https://www.meetup.com/aarhus-ruby-group/events/).
- Joining in Aarhus Clojure meetups, despite still falling short of converting over to Clojure myself.

### Programming

As side projects, this year I made:

- [An Azure Function that sends me a daily email](https://github.com/kcarta/hnews_feed) with [the top posts on Hacker News](https://news.ycombinator.com/best).
- [A flashcard-based language learning app in Flutter](https://github.com/kcarta/flash-cards-ru).
- A Flutter app that shows an infinite-scroll feed with all the emails in my "Feeds" folder in Gmail.
- A watchOS app + Ruby service that relays images from the baby camera to my Apple Watch.
- An Azure Function + Apple Shortcuts STT/TTS setup that sends my questions/prompts to ChatGPT and then speaks the answer back to me, from my iPhone & Apple Watch. 
- [A web page + API to check whether King Gizzard and the Lizard Wizard have released new music today](https://gizzdropwatch.com).
- A little [Ruby terminal script](https://github.com/kcarta/termgpt) that takes a prompt (e.g. 'how do I set a virtual environment in Python?'), sends it to the OpenAI API, and prints the result & copies it to my clipboard.
- A SwiftUI iOS/iPadOS app for my wife & I to quickly log grocery expenses into our family budget spreadsheet.

Then, I did some other nerdy stuff, including:
- [Restarting this blog!](https://github.com/kcarta/kcarta.github.io)
- Learning Emacs 💘
- Shelling out for a personal Apple Developer account 💸
- Falling back in love with Ruby, my very first programming language passion 🥰
- Getting a new Raspberry Pi 5, along with an AI module for it, and putzing around with local vision AI processing - though without any practical use cases coming out of it.

## Consumption:

### Movies
Close to 200 movies watched 😵‍💫 Can't imagine I'll top that ever again.

Highlights:
- [David Lynch](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TqZpi8zAqe0) becoming my favorite director.
- [Eraserhead](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eraserhead) affecting me in a way no other movie has, in perfectly capturing & expressing the anxieties & horrors of new fatherhood.
- Watching all of [Satoshi Kon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Satoshi_Kon)'s (tragically few) masterpieces for the first time.

Shortlist of favorites from 2024, seen in the theater:
1. Furiosa: A Mad Max Saga (3 times)
2. Dune: Part Two (twice)
3. Conclave

(This list might just reflect how few movies (6?) I've been able to see in the theater this year 😝)

### Books
Ca. 6000 pages read (4-year low 🤕 - 2023/10k, 2022/8k)

Books finished:
- [Wheel of Time series](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Wheel_of_Time), read books 1-5 and now mid-way through book 6.
- [Stormlight Archive 5: Wind and Truth](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wind_and_Truth), now ca. 450 pages in.
- [Napoleon: Soldier of Destiny](https://www.amazon.com/Napoleon-Michael-Broers/dp/0571273459) (tough read, expects the reader has a firm grounding in French history, which I most certainly don't/didn't!).
- [Masters of Doom](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Masters_of_Doom) (must read for gaming history enthusiasts & software nerds).
- [The Inmates are Running the Asylum](https://www.amazon.com/Inmates-Are-Running-Asylum-Products/dp/0672326140).
- [Unifying User Stories, Use Cases, Story Maps: the power of verbs](https://www.amazon.com/Unifying-User-Stories-Cases-Story/dp/1737519763).

*Not including the tall stack of books I picked up, didn't finish, and left aside for 2025 🙃*

### Music: 
Still spent most of the year stuck in the 1970s, but for new music, these stick out the most:
1. Chappell Roan:[^2] [The Rise and Fall of a Midwest Princess](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Rise_and_Fall_of_a_Midwest_Princess)
2. Beyonce: [Cowboy Carter](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cowboy_Carter)
3. St Vincent: [All Born Screaming](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/All_Born_Screaming)

5. Yannis & the Yaw:[^3] [Lagos Paris London](https://yannistheyaw.bandcamp.com/album/lagos-paris-london)

### TV
Only saw [Twin Peaks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twin_Peaks). But what a precious gem the first season is! And the third season is absolutely mind-melting in the best way possible 🤯

### Games
Big dropoff in my gaming this year. Lots of interesting games out there, just not enough time / will.
- [Stardew Valley](https://www.stardewvalley.net) coop, until my then-pregnant wife became too nauseated to game ☹️
- [Elden Ring: Shadow of the Erdtree](https://store.steampowered.com/app/2778580/ELDEN_RING_Shadow_of_the_Erdtree/) (Elden Ring ~=90% of my gaming this year)
- [Zelda: BotW](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Legend_of_Zelda:_Breath_of_the_Wild) (finally got to this masterpiece)

### Podcasts

- [Blank Check](https://www.blankcheckpod.com): Director filmographies. I've now listened to every one of their 500+ episodes, at ~2-3hrs each. 😵‍💫.
- [Ezra Klein Show](https://www.nytimes.com/column/ezra-klein-podcast): Stellar reporting this year on the issues I've cared about most: AI, politics+policy in America, the 2024 presidential election, the war in Ukraine, and of course the war(s) in Israel/Palestine. Very highly recommended!

[^1]: Lots of thoughts on this. We're planning to hand in the car as soon as our leasing agreement allows, and going back to the no-car life after ~6 years with.

[^2]: I got into Chappell Roan long before she became famous! I crave internet points for this!

[^3]: [Tony Allen](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCv7eyw8x4apOHE9pg4kunPA) was a genius and a master, do yourself a treat and listen to *anything* in his vast array of projects!
