2025 is here!

This week, I've been marking the changing of the years and enjoying my final week of parental leave before returning to work.

But *mostly* I've been in a haze of disrupted sleep caused by the dreaded "[4 Months Sleep Regression](https://www.sleepfoundation.org/baby-sleep/4-month-sleep-regression)" that my dear child is experiencing üòµ‚Äçüí´

Nonetheless, I still managed to read and watch some interesting (to me!) things, including:
- Affirming my thoughts about AI code assistants failing in large part due to the crappy context we give them, as shown by [Namanyay Goel in his article "The day I taught AI to read code like a Senior Developer"](https://nmn.gl/blog/ai-senior-developer),
- Laughing along to [Max Woolf's exploration](https://minimaxir.com/2025/01/write-better-code/
) of what repeatedly telling an LLM to "write better code" elicits,
- Reviewing "[Things we learned about LLMs in 2024](https://simonwillison.net/2024/Dec/31/llms-in-2024/)", and feeling relieved to find there isn't much I've missed,
- Nodding along with Steven Sinofsky's "[System Ideas that Sound Good But Almost Never Work](https://hardcoresoftware.learningbyshipping.com/p/225-systems-ideas-that-sound-good)",
- Appreciating [Ken Kantzer's convincing arguments](https://kenkantzer.com/technology-roi-discussions-are-broken/) that technology leaders have been improperly defining & using ROI to communicate the value of adopting a given technology,
- Drooling at all the juicy features the [Emacs Application Framework](https://github.com/emacs-eaf/emacs-application-framework?tab=readme-ov-file#features) offers, and planning to set aside an evening to try it out,
- Loving that my go-to tech site, the Verge, decided to write about my favorite metal band, [Sleep](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sleep_(band)), and [whether their  late-90's opus Dopesmoker should be regarded as "the heaviest album of all time"](https://www.theverge.com/2025/1/1/24333190/heavier-than-dopesmoker
). I don't *really* agree with their ultimate take, but that's fine, and I do find it fun to read articles like this and remember that some of my musical tastes might skew into corners most folks would consider...extreme...rock on! ü§ò 

Tomorrow, my first day back at work since mid-September. Let's see how many cups of coffee it takes me to get through the day! ‚òïÔ∏èüôÉ
