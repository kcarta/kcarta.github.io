At home, we're tying to re-establish a good weekly meal planning & grocery shopping routine.

For many years the steps have been:
1. Open up Notion
1. Make a new page like "Meal Plan: Week 2"
1. Write down what we'll eat on each day
1. For each meal, list out the items we need to get for it
1. (Add anything else we need to get for the week, like detergent)

The end result looks something like this:

With the meal plan written down, now we need to make a shopping list.

We've started using a shared "Shopping" list in Apple Reminders. The UX is great, and it all works quite well when we're actively shopping.[^1] [^2] We also have widgets on our phones so we can check the list with some quick gestures.

The irritating part is getting the items into the shopping list. I struggled to find a satisfying way to automate this part ðŸ˜£[^3] (until now!) .

At an impasse, I had given up, and kept awkwardly copy-pasting the ingredients from Notion over to Apple Reminders - of course this felt *wrong* every time I did it!

Recently I came across [this page showing how to invoke AppleScript from Emacs](https://irreal.org/blog/?p=4865) (because of course that's in Emacs!). 

I loathe AppleScript far more than is probably healthy, but sometimes it's the right - i.e. only - tool for the job.

After many iterations and some consultations with my private Emacs tutor, ChatGPT, I scratched together a function to add an item into the Shopping list in Apple Reminders:

> Note: if this code can be improved, let me know! I'm still a beginner here and guidance is greatly appreciated.

```elisp
(defun my-add-item-to-shopping-reminders (item)
  "Prompt for ITEM and add it to the â€˜Shoppingâ€™ list in Apple Reminders."
  (interactive "sAdd item to Shopping: ")
  (let ((as-command (format
	"tell application \"Reminders\"
		tell list \"Shopping\"
			make new reminder with properties {name:\"%s\"}
		end tell
	end tell"
	item)))
    (message "AppleScript: %s" as-command)  ;; Debug
    (shell-command (format "osascript -e '%s'" as-command))))
```

I ended up going with `shell-command` and `osascript` because I couldn't get past permissions issues between Emacs and Reminders when using `do-applescript` - I spent a lot of time troubleshooting this before finally giving up ðŸ˜ž

With this milestone reached, there was just one step remaining: process the shopping list items, using the power of Emacs ðŸ™Œ

With a deal great more iterations and head-scratching, I managed to make a script that:
1. Parses an Org buffer into an AST
2. Gets all the list items from the AST
3. Gets the content of the list items and pushes it into a list
4. For each item in the list of content, calls AppleScript to add it to the Apple Reminders "Shopping" list.

> Sidebar: The hardest part in my Emacs learning has been finding a good reference flow for Emacs / library API's. I know I can look things up in Emacs with C-h, but if I don't *know* what to look up, then I end up online and searching around aimlessly. This [Org Element API](https://orgmode.org/worg/dev/org-element-api.html) is quite helpful, but I wish I knew how to find it in Emacs and I still wish it were better organized and more detailed. [I'm used to things like this](https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/docs/current/javadoc-api/org/springframework/aop/framework/autoproxy/target/AbstractBeanFactoryBasedTargetSourceCreator.html), where even if the subject is...arcane..., I'm presented with *everything* I need to know and with copious links to explore further, and everything here is usually 1:1 with the help my editor presents.

The script:
```elisp
(defun my-add-org-items-to-shopping-reminders ()
  "Extract all list items from the current Org buffer and add them to the 'Shopping' list in Apple Reminders."
  (interactive)
  (require 'org-element)
  ;; Extract all list items
  (let ((parsed (org-element-parse-buffer))
        (items '()))
    (org-element-map parsed 'item
      (lambda (item)
        (let ((content (org-element-property :contents-begin item))
              (end (org-element-property :contents-end item)))
          (when (and content end)
            (push (buffer-substring-no-properties content end) items)))))
    ;; Add each item to Apple Reminders
    (dolist (item (reverse items))
      (let ((as-command (format
                         "tell application \"Reminders\"
                            tell list \"Shopping\"
                              make new reminder with properties {name:\"%s\"}
                            end tell
                          end tell"
                         item)))
        (message "Adding to Reminders: %s" item)  ;; Debug
        (shell-command (format "osascript -e '%s'" as-command)))))
  (message "All items added to the 'Shopping' list."))
```

Now, I have a new routine:

1. Make the Meal Plan in Notion as usual, with the lists of items we need to get at the store:
![Meal plan in Notion](/static/img/posts/meal-plan-notion.png)

2. Copy the entire Notion page and paste it into an Emacs buffer (even \*scratch\* works for this):
![Meal plan in Markdown](/static/img/posts/meal-plan-md.png)

3. Convert Notion's Markdown into Org[^4]
![Meal plan in Org](/static/img/posts/meal-plan-org.png)

4. Run the command to send the list items to Apple Reminders:
![Command to send meal plan items to Apple Reminders](/static/img/posts/meal-plan-command.png)

5. Go shopping! ðŸ›’
![Shopping list in Apple Reminders](/static/img/posts/meal-plan-reminders.png)

[^1]: As much as I otherwise love it, Notion has never been 'lightweight' to use on mobile, and is often a real distraction in cases where I *just need* something, like a checklist to quickly reference and update.

[^2]: Also, it's important to keep the meal planning in Notion, because my partner, as smart & wonderful as they otherwise are, is not about to start using some nerdy text editor (ðŸ˜¿) or a half-baked app I've written myself (we have enough of those already). Much of our family planning, including our recipes, is also done in Notion.

[^3]: At least one that doesn't require adding an additional service promising to synchronize the two platforms - no thanks!

[^4]: Not shown: a simple function I have to convert md->org in the same buffer, using a shell command to `pandoc`. Also, I did have the thought to just process a md buffer, but I don't know of a good parser for that and I avoid writing regexes whenever possible. I'm fine with have one extra command in my process (for now ðŸ™ƒ).
