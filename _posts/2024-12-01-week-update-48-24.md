This week, I've been hosting family and have had very little time for tech nerdery or content consumption of any sort, but I have nonetheless been:

- Commiserating with and feeling very 'seen' by Kristen Radtke's incredible comic ["How to Watch a Baby"](https://www.theverge.com/c/24278723/comic-baby-monitor-surveillance-history-tech),
- Inching closer towards purchasing [Engineering in Plain Sight](https://nostarch.com/engineering-plain-sight),
- Feeling every victory and defeat in YouTuber Marcin Plaza's quest to [build a "DIY Steam Deck Thingy"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJccc3qpPh0)

This week, I have also learned that we Americans are LOUD, and probably shouldn't be in small rooms together for extended periods of time:

I can't see this and not think about open office workspaces. Thankfully I work in Denmark and don't have to fear for my physical (ear) health, but I do wonder what the constant noise around me does to my mental health, across a week of being in open office spaces.
