The [busy of autumn]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link _posts/2020-10-27-under-pressure.md %}
) gave way to a much-needed winter holiday reprieve, which then gradually ramped into a January and February that were less busy, but which felt chaotic and taxing in their own way.

Taking a round of self-inspection at the start of spring, I notice a few problems:

- My [to-do list system]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link _posts/2020-11-24-todo.md %}) is looking worse for wear. I've been using it, but only half-heartedly, more often than not updating it to reflect the course of a day (or more) gone past, not to help plan or structure my daily activities.
- I haven't picked back up some of the activities that I dropped when things got too busy, such as this blog. These took effort, but also helped get me reflecting and would inspire me to try out new ways of working.
- I've stopped using structuring techniques like my purpose-driven pomodoro timer - the name of the game lately has been to do random activities until it's time for the next meeting(s).
- I'm massively distracted by every new email that comes in, and every notification dot that pops up on Slack and Teams. Every new ping is an excuse to change track entirely.
- As noted in January, [endless remote communication is proving to be massively draining]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link _posts/2021-01-05-remote-comms.md %}).

Do any of these items seem familiar to you? What're your particular struggles, especially starting up on a strange year like this one?

For me, the next question becomes "where do I start?" 

After making this post (see, I'm already starting to tackle this list!), getting my to-do list back in order seems like a good starting point, since it shouldn't take much time to "fix", and helps to structure my daily "flow". 

I'll update on how that goes!
