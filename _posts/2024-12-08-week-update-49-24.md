This week, I've been:

- Following [EmacsConf 2024](https://emacsconf.org/2024/) and strongly considering going back to having a [literate Emacs config](https://youtu.be/9eEtPnTknhQ), migrating my personal organization from Notion to Org-mode, and maybe converting this site from Jekyll to [Org/Hugo](https://ox-hugo.scripter.co),
- Feeding my people-watching obsession[^1] by binge-watching [videos uploaded from iPhones to YouTube from ~2009-2012](https://walzr.com/IMG_0001/),
- Rehearsing my internal database of [Yogi Berra quotes](https://yogiberramuseum.org/about-yogi/yogisms/) (favorite: "We made too many wrong mistakes"),
- Nodding my head to "[The 6 Mistakes You're Going to Make as a New Manager](https://terriblesoftware.org/2024/12/04/the-6-mistakes-youre-going-to-make-as-a-new-manager/)",
- Picking up the new [Stormlight Archive: Wind and Truth](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wind_and_Truth) and promptly retreating to [chapter summaries of the previous books](https://coppermind.net/wiki/Summary:The_Way_of_Kings),
- Enjoying a rare long night out as a new parent at my company [julefrokost](https://www.thelocal.dk/20181211/10-tips-for-surviving-a-danish-christmas-party), then recovering much of the following day ðŸ˜‡

It's been a quick week! I spent most of my pockets of free time (mostly between midnight and 1am) working on [my epic post on using ChatGPT and Flutter to rapidly produce applications]({% post_url 2024-12-07-llm-success-with-flutter %}). I've been working on this one in spurts over the past few weeks, so it's a massive relief to be done with it and able to spend my time on other topics, which hopefully I'll be posting about over the coming week.
