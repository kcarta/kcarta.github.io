If you've had the pleasure of working in stressful projects (and who hasn't!?), you're likely to have witnessed some shockingly self-destructive behaviors. You have probably seen the extensive damage these behaviors can cause. Even more disturbing, you've probably observed moments where a *reasonable person acting in good faith*, has said something completely *normal*, but in a specific context or with certain people, resulting in that *reasonable* comment growing out of proportion and triggering astoundingly severe consequences. This is unfair, yes, but it happens, because projects are human and humans are social creatures who often have opaquely conflicting pressures and goals. This goes doubly for customers[^1], whose anxieties regarding a project often differ radically from the project team's. I reckon that if you're looking out for this process, or in a role that forces you to be politically attuned, you can spot it as it happens on most any project. 

With the primary goal of protecting my team members from their own good intentions, I recently thought up a set of **commandments** to dictate behavior on a project, especially in the presence of a customer[^1]. At first I thought these would be fun joke material, but after having drafted the list, I started to admire how, as **commandments**, they speak as if coming from a far-away voice of authority, against seemingly mundane transgressions whose consequences could nonetheless be severe and eternal. Like the *original* commandments, these are meant to protect team members against their own natural tendencies (*a reasonable person acting in good faith*...).

# 10 Commandments in the Presence of a Customer[^1]

> To protect yourself, your team, your project, and your company

1. Thou shalt respond “I’ll have to check and get back to you” when asked questions you cannot answer with 100% confidence and when asked to commit the team to something[^2]
2. Thou shalt not claim responsibility for a defect[^3]
3. Thou shalt listen first, and create quiet moments for the customer to give input
4. Thou shalt not argue
5. Thou shalt not discuss company project, financial, staffing, or political matters
6. Thou shalt not discuss project political or financial matters
7. Thou shalt not speak poorly of another teammate, customer, user, or partner
8. Thou shalt not speak poorly of the code or the system
9. Thou shalt be transparent about your responsibilities, and defer to others about their responsibilities
10. Thou shalt respect and work within agreed practices and not create loopholes, even if asked by the customer[^1]

*Do you have comments or proposals for amendments to this list? I'd love to hear them!*

[^1]: Or stakeholder, sponsor, user, ... 
[^2]: This isn't to be slippery or evasive, but to avoid misleading people, and the eventual finger-pointing and he-said-she-said conflicts that arise when responsibility is taken but can't be tracked. Formal channels should exist for sharing and tracking information and decisions.
[^3]: There should also be established processes for defect triage, investigation, RCA, etc., which protect individuals against assuming blame.
