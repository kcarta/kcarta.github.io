This being a typical holiday week here in Denmark, I took Thursday & Friday off in order to get some more time with baby and take care of some 'dad chores' around the house. At the end of this four-day weekend I feel a bit relaxed and accomplished, but still quite tired ðŸ˜´ 

I spent my pockets of time this week:
- Re-watching E.T., spellbound by it's many magic moments, especially this frame which I had to rewind back to, pause, and admire:

- Nodding my head to [this piece on taste & tradeoffs in software development in the age of AI](https://thejackobrien.com/blog/taste-and-tradeoffs). I feel inspired to write a bit on how a manager develops good taste, as a follow-up to [my recent post on taste in the workplace]({% post_url 2025-02-14-on-taste %}).
- On a nerdier tack, loving this [in-depth history of S.u.S.E.](https://www.abortretry.fail/p/the-history-of-suse), the company behind SUSE Linux (the chameleon one). SUSE was never one of the distros I tried for long, but I did unexpectedly walk past their office in Nuremberg and perhaps overreacted in my excitement,
- Consulting Atlassian's surprisingly thorough [guide on making heatmaps](https://www.atlassian.com/data/charts/heatmap-complete-guide) (why did they write this?), for an investigation I'm doing into how my mental state & environment affect what I consume & produce,
- Playing around with [Meta's AI demo's](https://aidemos.meta.com) - fun to get a sense of what's possible with some creative use of LLM's. I'll end with this result, from a source video of my dog running around in the park:
