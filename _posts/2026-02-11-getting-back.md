...it's been a while, blog!
Life has been intense - new house, small child, stressful work days - measurable in ways such as the sharp decline in posts I've managed to publish.[^1]

My goal with this post is to *just get something published*.

I have a handful of drafts going, which neatly capture my interests and state of mind as of late:

- AI, AI, AI
  - Claude Code taking my hypothesis on [AI-driven development]({% post_url 2024-11-18-rad-llms %}) far, far further than I'd imagined it would be at this point.
  - My experiences - mostly positive - with 'vibe coding', something I'd thoroughly shunned just a few months ago but have now embraced wholly (in a specific context!!!).
- My experiences with home networking, now that I have a house to wire up - nearly entirely positive thanks to fortuitous product decisions (Unifi + Home Assistant FTW) 😄
- Agile & Scrum - some "back to basics" thoughts / screeds, lessons learned from the battlefield. I have thoughts brewing on how I see the coming wave of AI-driven development impacting teams & companies, especially in terms of product development processes in enterprise software, so hopefully I can build up momentum and dig into these.
