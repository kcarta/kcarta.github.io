This Christmas week, I didn't get a whole lot consumed outside of some delicious food, but did find time for:

- Reading [this excellent post on Cognitive load](https://minds.md/zakirullin/cognitive) (for developers), and quickly brainstorming the version of this for managers (maybe worthy of a post?),
- Exploring Ken Kantzer's well-considered blog posts, including this on '[Learning from 5 years of tech startup code audits](https://kenkantzer.com/learnings-from-5-years-of-tech-startup-code-audits/)' - lots here also relevant for established enterprises, much of this is very familiar (sigh ðŸ˜”),
- Learning about (and drooling over) how simple it is to [make masa dough & corn tortillas from scratch](https://www.mexicanplease.com/homemade-masa-dough-using-yellow-field-corn/), even in a cramped apartment, quickly shooting to the top of my backlog of projects for '25,
- Listening to the absolutely stomping ['What We All Want'](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WHVAahhreSQ) off of Gang Of Four's 1981 'Solid Gold', and wondering why this band wasn't a huge part of my adolescence,
- And watching the ridiculous-but-fun [Gladiator II](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gladiator_II), the follow-up I never knew I wanted to one of my all-time favorite films. Special for being my first film seen in the cinema since becoming a papa.

I'm looking forward to 2025. Of course shutting out events in the world, I'm optimistic about the path my own life is on. If what comes out of this year for me personally is quality time spent with my family, a little bit of traveling, and some engaging work, then I'll be quite happy. 2024 has been the most major 'rock the boat' year in my life, so maybe some stability in the year to come wouldn't be the worst thing.
