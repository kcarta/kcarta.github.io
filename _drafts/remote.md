> Digital communication is like eating Pringles

> You start eating, don't get satisfied, then you binge eat and are left **even more unsatisfied**

As a (remote) software project manager, and, thanks to COVID-19 blocking all travel for the foreseeable future, all of my workdays now revolve around digital communication. On any given day I spend somewhere between 6 to 10 hours communicating with my teams, colleagues, and customers, via any number of chat apps, emails, and virtual meeting apps[^1]. Without regular travel or an office to work from[^2], I have spent most of 2020 engaging with dozens of people around the world, from in front of my computer screen.

 After a typical workday filled with constantly-updating chat channels and hours of virtual meetings, I can find myself mentally dazed and emotionally numb, similar to the physical feeling of having downed a can of Pringles in one go (one I *also* know all-too-embarrassingly well!). Digital communication not only fails to meet my needs, it depletes me of the energy I need to live my personal life and to navigate this period of insane sociopolitical and economic chaos. 

This personal revelation has had me wondering lately about the importance of personal connection, especially with my team members and my customers, and what this means in 2020 when our only communication medium is digital. Most people crave social connection, myself included, and we suffer when that need isn't met. 

My overriding functions as a project manager are to protect and nurture my team members, and to stay attentive to my customer's needs. Doing so requires emotional clarity and attentiveness. This leaves us in a bind - is it possible to succeed in a jobwhich hinges so heavily on emotional connection, when the only communication methods available are emotionally distant and, at worst, numbing and alienating?


All of this is why I listened with such interest to a recent episode titled ["'Can You Hear Me?' How to Connect with People in a Virtual World", with Nick Morgan on the New Books in Sociology podcast network](https://open.spotify.com/episode/51wlk6LF7vYeIaXVqNYtcr?si=mDlxUxCeTK-7hkV2GuUIgQ).

In the next few posts, I'll grapple with some of the interesting points raised in this episode. I 
## "So what does everyone think about this?" -> *silence*

> The digital pause is uncomfortable

> In person, you get an instant read, instant feedback...no one assumes, "they think that's such a good idea they're stunned into silence". We think people find us contemptable in those micropauses

- Intent is not clear

> Emotional compression - what gets lost?

How do you compensate for these limitations?

Communication on software projects is challenging and stressful, even in the best of circumstances. Software developers and customers are two groups notorious for their inability to communicate effectively - *mediating between these two groups is a significant part of my job as a project manager*. I recall a workshop with agilist Alistair Cockburn where his advice on running effective remote teams boiled down to *don't*.

## Intimacy

You need intimacy

> You can only create intimacy with fewer than 6 people

> A good team size is however many people you can feed with 2 large pizzas
