I love this quote:

> Digital communication is like eating pringles

> You start eating, don't get satisfied, then you binge eat and are left **even more unsatisfied**

My job as a (remote) delivery manager, and, thanks to COVID-19, all of my workdays, is currently geared around digital remote communication. On any given day I can spend somewhere between 4 to 10 hours communicating with my teams, co-workers, and customers, via a handful of chat apps, email, and at least 5 different audio/video meeting apps[^1]. 

I have spent most of 2020 in a bizarre digital coccoon, stretching my reach around the world yet r 

Communication on software projects is  even in the best of contextsLaying it all out like this makes my daily undertaking seem, frankly, rather *absurd*.

All of this is why I listened with such interest to a recent episode titled "'Can You Hear Me?' How to Connect with People in a Virtual World", on the New Books in Sociology podcast network.

## (Human) signal loss over digital media

> Information about human intent comes through via body language

> The digital pause is uncomfortable

> In person, you get an instant read, instant feedback...no one assumes, "they think that's such a good idea they're stunned into silence". We think people find us contemptable in those micropauses

- Intent is not clear

> Emotional compression - what gets lost?

How do you compensate for these limitations?

## Trust 

How do you increase trust in virutal converstations, how do you gain it back when it's been lost?

> Online we use different criteria than we normally do for human trust

> *Consistency is the most important thing*

> Be relentlessly, forever, inhumanly consistent

> Consistency of mode, means, amount, timing

> *Now is not hte time to experiment*

### Red light, yellow light, green light

> *what happens if everyoen red lights?*
> - Set up 1:1 calls and find out what's going on

## Intimacy

You need intimacy

> You can only create intimacy with fewer than 6 people

> A good team size is however many people you can feed with 2 large pizzas

> Rise of digital communication changes the nature of the company-customer relationship forever

> We take information much more negatively when it comes to us virtually than face to face
