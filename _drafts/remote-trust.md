> Digital communication is like eating Pringles

> You start eating, don't get satisfied, then you binge eat and are left **even more unsatisfied**

As a (remote) software project manager, and, thanks to COVID-19 blocking all travel for the foreseeable future, all of my workdays now revolve around digital communication. On any given day I spend somewhere between 6 to 10 hours communicating with my teams, colleagues, and customers, via any number of chat apps, emails, and virtual meeting apps[^1]. Without travel or a shared office[^2], I have spent most of 2020 in a bizarre electronic cocoon, interacting with many dozens of people around the world while at the same time never leaving my home "office".

Like most people, I crave social connection, and I suffer in uncomfortable ways when that need isn't met. After a typical workday filled with constantly-updating online chat threads and virtual meetings, I often find myself mentally dazed and emotionally numb, similar to the physical feeling of having downed a can of Pringles in one sitting (one I know all-too-embarrassingly well!). Digital communication not only fails to meet my needs, it depletes the energy I need to live my personal life and navigate this period of insane sociopolitical and economic chaos. 

This personal revelation makes me wonder - I love my job, co-workers, and customers, so what can I do to support us all, who have similar social needs but must rely on draining digital interaction?

Communication on software projects is challenging and stressful, even in the best of circumstances. Software developers and customers are two groups notorious for their inability to communicate effectively - *mediating between these two groups is a significant part of my job as a project manager*. I recall a workshop with agilist Alistair Cockburn where his advice on running effective remote teams boiled down to *don't*.

All of this is why I listened with such interest to a recent episode titled ["'Can You Hear Me?' How to Connect with People in a Virtual World", with Nick Morgan on the New Books in Sociology podcast network](https://open.spotify.com/episode/51wlk6LF7vYeIaXVqNYtcr?si=mDlxUxCeTK-7hkV2GuUIgQ).


## (Human) signal loss over digital media

> Information about human intent comes through via body language

When I am looking into a screen, how do I infer intent?

In a best case, the person I am communicating with has their camera turned on. I can read the broad signs drawn on their face, maybe infer some signals from what they're doing with their hands. I can't typically see into someone's eyes, but I can clearly tell when their focus is on me, or when it's on something else.

This gives me the bare minimum level of social trust I need to make a meaningful connection.

In the worst case, the other person has their camera off. I maybe see a picture of an avatar, or of their face in some blurry profile picture. I have no way of see them clicking away at the keyboard distractedly while 

I always strive to keep my camera on. I don't typically ask others, or people on my teams, to do so, as with so many working from home, I don't want to be overly assertive about how comfortable others are about bringing me into their homes. 

## "So what does everyone think about this?" -> *silence*

> The digital pause is uncomfortable

> In person, you get an instant read, instant feedback...no one assumes, "they think that's such a good idea they're stunned into silence". We think people find us contemptable in those micropauses

- Intent is not clear

> Emotional compression - what gets lost?

How do you compensate for these limitations?

## Trust 

How do you increase trust in virutal converstations, how do you gain it back when it's been lost?

> Online we use different criteria than we normally do for human trust

> *Consistency is the most important thing*

> Be relentlessly, forever, inhumanly consistent

> Consistency of mode, means, amount, timing

> *Now is not the time to experiment*

## Intimacy

You need intimacy

> You can only create intimacy with fewer than 6 people

> A good team size is however many people you can feed with 2 large pizzas

## Feedback and negativity

> Rise of digital communication changes the nature of the company-customer relationship forever

> We take information much more negatively when it comes to us virtually than face to face
