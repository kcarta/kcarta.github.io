## Product Owner


## Use single prioritized backlog of work

A large enough project will have multiple official stakeholders, beyond its primary sponsor (e.g. a board). It is highly unlikely that the interests of all the concerned stakeholders, affected business units, the project development team, and so on, will align. To have a hope of success, the project must respect and consider the interests of these parties, but it must have one clear, singular backlog of work, owned and maintained by a single Product Owner. Especially within a legacy-laden enterprise, there will undoubtedly be many competing interests putting pressure on the project. In such an atmosphere, a project divided against itself cannot succeed. To me, this is a no-brainer.

### How do you feed the single backlog?

The question of how to fill this backlog, is one I'd like to examine in a standalone post. Understanding, estimating, planning, and delivering on t*he delta* is the killer element of integration projects.

### Prioritization

This single backlog must also be prioritized. It is rare to see backlog items in an integration project that aren't either essential for technical reasons, or of high priority for one or several key stakeholders. Prioritization methods - MoSCoW for example - can be valuable in highlighting the exceptions, the scope that *can* be negotiated. As a method for steering the project, I consider prioritization important, but with quickly diminishing returns due to the technical necessity of most of the work in an integration project.

### Ordering > Prioritizing

Ordering the backlog is a lot more important than prioritizing it. One key challenge for a Product Owner in an integration project is that the ordering of the work is largely technically-driven. How is a PO, especially one lacking a technical background, supposed to understand the "natural" technical ordering of the backlog items? 

*By working closely with the development team*, I reckon. With active input from the development team, the Product Owner can still own the backlog and ensure that the work on it is properly ordered. This is a lot of work, probably more than a single Product Owner can handle in a busy enterprise organization! However, this should open up a few strategic opportunities such as early identification and resolution of dependencies, coordination of support activities for development, test, and release, and hopefully the ability to do some value-driven prioritization as well.
