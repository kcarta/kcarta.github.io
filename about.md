Thank you for visiting my site!

I work as a software delivery lead (i.e. a kind of engineering manager but in consulting). I transitioned over to this after being in a variety of software engineer/architect roles. Previous to all of this, I got a MSc in Sociology and dabbled in local politics. There's quite a few circles in the venn diagram of my interests, all intersecting neatly on "software".

My burning topics of late are AI, software project delivery (in enterprise!), Emacs, and whatever nifty software lifehacks I can whip together and are worth sharing.

This site started as a way for me to pin down my thoughts on tough questions around project/product delivery, agility, consulting, tech leadership, and similar topics. Now, I use it more as a dumping ground for *all* of my thoughts, at least all that are tech related (as most are - at any given moment I'm *probably* thinking about software and how we use & work with it 👨🏻‍💻)

I always love having discussions, so please feel free to hit me up on LinkedIn or Bluesky or whatever!
