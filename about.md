I am a software manager and engineer, passionate about delivering complex projects through skilled application of Agile methodologies and values. My technical experience is primarily in full-stack web development and web service architectures in .NET and Java, and following extreme programming (XP) ways of working.

I love to talk about all these topics and more!
