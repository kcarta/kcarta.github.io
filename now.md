## What I'm Doing Now

Working at [Trifork](https://trifork.com/), now on a longer-term engagement as a process architect.

## What I'm Working With

### Work:
- Working with a single customer (for the first time in my 7+ years as a consultant) in a process coaching & facilitation role (roughly, a Scrum Master). Learning a lot about how smaller organizations handle change, pressure, and politics 🕵🏻‍♂️ 
- Re-picking up our cross-office 'delivery guild' and preparing some new templates for when we initially size and frame a delivery.
- Acting as a 'team lead', representing a handful of co-workers in their well-being & development at work, and more general HR-ish matters.

### Hobby projects (ranked by time spent):
- Working on my new (old) house 🏡
- Setting up a 'smart' home based on Ubiquiti's Unifi platform and Home Assistant.
- Getting back into Emacs and blogging.

## What I'm Consuming

### Reading

- Re-reading [Caesar, Life of a Colossus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caesar,_Life_of_a_Colossus), by Adrian Goldsworthy
- Followed very likely by a re-read of [Augustus: First Emperor of Rome](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/20949792-augustus), also by Adrian Goldsworthy

### Watching

- Re-watching the [Avatar: the Last Airbender](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Avatar:_The_Last_Airbender) series, little by little when we have time in the evenings.
- Music videos on Spotify! Curated mega-playlists with hundreds of songs, for [the 80s](https://open.spotify.com/playlist/4uXK0vy0kPt0jYGb3lh1Sc?si=cb620b61a78545eb), [90s](https://open.spotify.com/playlist/1MqdXFGWYDVKPu0YVgOSlr?si=16e74959ebed443b), and across [all my favorites](https://open.spotify.com/playlist/1S5TNImJ4EdgdWy5hz2psj?si=d72c64c12f7e421e).

### Listening
