## What I'm Doing Now

Working full-time at [Trifork Smart Enterprise](https://trifork.com/work/smart-enterprise/), having fun tracking developments in enterprise IT dept's & how they're beginning to adopt durable (Gen-)AI initiatives.

Taking things one day at a time after returning back to work after a glorious ~4 month paternity leave üë®üèª‚ÄçüçºStill in awe of every smile and coo ü•∞ 

Trying to figure out how to do anything productive with the new demands on my time & energy. Tired, so tired üò™ 

## What I'm Working With

### Work:
- Leading product development on a big custom enterprise data platform, in my typical "many hats" consultant role as PO, PM, analyst / solution arch, etc.
- Picking up our cross-office 'delivery guild' and facilitating preparation of a robust and (most importantly) useful delivery framework.
- Acting as a 'team lead', representing a handful of co-workers in their well-being & development at work, and more general HR-ish matters.

### Hobby projects (ranked by time spent):
- Investigating how my mental state and environment impact how & what I can reasonably expect to be able to consume and produce. Some posts on the way!
- [Learning Elisp](https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_mono/eintr.html), in an attempt to up my Emacs game from noob to intermediate.
