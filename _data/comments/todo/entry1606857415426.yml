message: "Thanks for the comment Nigel! \r\nI haven't used Evernote in years, but I do recall it being quite simple. Having individual to-do lists sounds like it would help reduce some of the chaos I occasionally get on my to-do list. I wonder if there's a happy middle ground - I would love to be able to keep my master todo list, and then have that break down into sub-to-do-lists specific to each project. I think that might be possible with Notion's filtered views (https://www.notion.so/Intro-to-databases-fd8cd2d212f74c50954c11086d85997e#0f5be5f049184ca0bf4e80253083d5a5). Sounds like a good holiday mini-project..."
