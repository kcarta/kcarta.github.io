message: "Kris, great post :-)\r\nI was always impressed with your organisation ability and use of Notion. The Notion tool is good. I use Evernote more though. It’s not as good at drag and drop like Notion but I like it’s simplicity. \r\nAs I work on multiple separate things at the same time I have individual to do lists for each with a parent page that links to each one. In each I then have my to do list. I’m going to use your “doing” concept, I like that. I also like the quick notes area. I tend to have separate notes for each of those, so I’m going to create a quick notes section to have links to each of those. \r\nI do also use a mind node for very detailed notes, especially good for keeping track of progress on user stories over time."
